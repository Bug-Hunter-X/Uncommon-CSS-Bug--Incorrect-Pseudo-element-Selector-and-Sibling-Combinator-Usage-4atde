The solution involves correctly nesting selectors to style pseudo-elements.  For example, instead of:

```css
/* Incorrect */
.element::before { color: blue; }
```

Use the following:

```css
/* Correct */
.element {
  &:before {
    content: "Text";
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

If you encounter issues with sibling combinators alongside pseudo-elements, restructuring your CSS may be required to achieve the desired styling effect without invalid selectors.
