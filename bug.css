The following CSS code snippet attempts to style an element based on the presence of a pseudo-element (:before), but it uses an invalid selector:

```css
/* Incorrect selector */
.element::before { /* styles here */ }
```

This is problematic because the pseudo-element's styles should be defined within its own declaration block. A correct way is to nest the pseudo-element selector within the main element's selector:

```css
/* Correct selector */
.element {
  /* styles for the element itself */
  &:before {
      content: 'This text will appear before the element';
      /* Add more styles for :before */
  }
}
```

Another subtle issue arises when using a sibling combinator alongside a pseudo-element. A selector such as `.element + ::before` is invalid. In such cases, consider adjusting your CSS structure to ensure appropriate targeting.
